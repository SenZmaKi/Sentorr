The amount of amazing episodes Sam has created is insane and it makes me wonder why this show has only an 8.5, it deserves at least an 8.8 or higher.With all that out of the way, here are my ratings for each season.Season 1.0 - 9.5\namazing start to a series, especially the first episode, a few episodes later it gets less interesting, but after seeing episode 6, 8, and 9, I knew I was in for something special.Season 2.0 - 8.0\na bit of a weak season tbh, it had some really good moments, especially near the end, but at the end of the day, it's probably the worst season of the show. But it's definitely not badSeason 3.0 - 9.0\nsignificant upgrade from season 2, featuring some really good episodes such as, \"runtime error\", \"kill process\", \"don't delete me\" and \"shutdown-r\"Season 4.0 - 10.0\nwords can't describe how amazing this season was. From having the greatest opener episode in the show to an incredibly sad series finale, this season will probably be the most memorable other than season 1. Especially with episodes such as \"407 Proxy Authentication Required\", \"405 method not allowed\", \"eXit\", \"Whoami\", and of course, \"hello, Elliot\"bravo Sam, bravo.",

    "title": "Quite literally one of the best TV Shows ever made in my opinion!",
    "author": "Shmaden",
    "rating": 10,
    "content": "Right! I'm not gonna waste any second! Mr. Robot is quite literally one of the greatest pieces of entertainment ever created! A tight, sharply written, expertly acted, fantastically scored and majestically produced TV masterpiece. A breath of fresh air in an otherwise lackluster state of cinema in general over the past decade or so. This is a show that was carefully planned and executed from the very begining up until the last scene of it. A TV show that had me gripping from the first scene until the last satisfying and epic conclusion. A show that stayed with me, captivated me, haunts me and at the same time inspires me. A show that tells a unique story with multiple social commentary and lessons to be learned from it. Truly, masterpieces like this are hard to come by! I couldn't even fit the plot of this show in this single review, so instead I'll just talk about the things I love about this show, so here we go:The story: This show has one of the most complex stories I've ever seen in any medium. And at times, especially the first season, it's hard to keep up with it. There are so many things happening, but it's not like \"Rapid-fire stupidity\" from JJ Abrams where you can't even pause for a second to think about what just happened before the next stupid event comes along. It's rather a very layered, multi-dimensional, multi-perspective story full of unique characters that feel and act diferently in their own way. Simply put the plot of this show is about a hacker named Elliot who wants to destroy that status quo by tacking down the top 1% of the top 1%. The ones who play God without permission. From there the show develops into something a lot more and different with shocks and twists better than almost anything you see in any TV show. That is achieved mainly due to the fact that the story is told through Elliot's perspective, him being the narator but at the same time an unreliable one. So when things are recontextualized, you know you're in for some cool twists. I'll also mention here the incredible work put into programing by the creators of this show. Literally every single line of programing code was done for real and it looks amazing. And there are times when you can gaze upon the algorithms Elliot uses and it's clear they are authentically made, and that gaves the Show an even more authentic feeling.The Characters and acting: As I already mentioned, the characters are all unique, different and with their own unique set of qualities and flaws. And here I'll be going a little more into the acting of this show. It is quite literally a masterclass in acting. I mean at times you even froget you are watching actors playing some TV roles, but rather think you're watching someone's life develop in front of you. Not a single performance in this show is forced, nothing comes across as appaling or overacting. Everything feels natural, grounded in reality and interesting to watch. And it is refreshing to see such good performances with good stories, they actually enhance one another. I usually don't get excited about acting, because most of our film industry uses story in order to give actors great performances to win prizes at awards ceremonies. But here, even I must admit that the show is expertly played and acted, with every single actor giving a believable performance that imerses you even further into the world this show creates.The screenplay: Now, I'm no expert in screewritting but I've watched a decent amount of TV shows and movies to know when I'm watching a well written show or movie and when I'm watching utter garbage. And this is a fantastical written show with excelent dialogue and crazy and unexpected twists that leave the audience at times completely baffled by what just happened. And here is where the actual praise begins. Sam Esmail is the creator of this show and also the writer and man does he do a fantastic job with it. Literally every single aspect of this show is meticulously planed to the point where at the end you'll realise the whole show was carefully planed from the begining. I've mentioned the twists in this show, and well, Sam leaves the greatest and best twist of them all until the very end in what I can only describe as one of the most mind-blowing and satisfying finales I think I've ever watched.The score: Another thing the show exceeds at is the music. And honestly speaking Mac Quayle wasn't a guy about whom I knew a lot going into this show. In fact I never heard of him up until this show. But boy does he delives a fantastic score. The soundtrack is absolutely pitch perfectly made for this show. It enchances the atmoshpere and the tension when it needs to. And at the same time is horifingly haunting after you listen it for a while. Truly a master work here!Honestly I can't say enough great things about Mr. Robot. It's an expertly crafted, thightly written, flawlessly acted, hauntingly scored Tv masterpiece. The like of which you only find once in a lifetime. It's something cinema was invented for. No CGI nonsense or overblown big set pieces, instead everything in this show is grounded, real and very authentic, to the point that you could even think that something like this could very well happen in real life. If I were to pick gripes I might have with this show, the only thing that really bothered me was how the show resolves Tyrell Wellick's storyline. It felt somewhat cheap and glossed over, like they didn't have time to give it a proper resolution, and just thrown a random scene in there. The other thing would be just a minor gripe, and that is that the show is at times hard to follow, especially in the second half of season 1 and the entirety of season 2. But those rather slow burns are necessary in order for the third and fourth seasons to shine. Aside from that, this show is pretty much flawless in every way. I would even go as far as calling it the best written show I've watched and in my opinion the greatest written show ever! It's one of those rare gems that are ignored by many people but which influence and inspire the ones that do watch them. And I wholeheartedly recomend you watch this show! It truly is one of the best ever! 10/10",

    "author": "J49afc",
    "rating": 10,
    "content": "My favourite TV show of all time is the Office. Whilst that's great and all for some light hearted, switch off, bingeable entertainment, I really wanted to find something more story and character driven I could get into. And boy did I find it.This TV show is a masterpiece. The characters are so layered and interesting and this is only enhanced by the captivating performances from the talented cast. Malek gives a mysterious and at times sinister- yet somehow likeable- performance as Elliot. He ramps it up and knocks it out of the park when depicting Elliot's mental health issues, and this delivers one of the most painful, yet grounded depictions of mental health ever put on the screen. His performances alongside the brilliant Christian Slater create an incredible dynamic that carries the show forwards. The supporting cast are all great and are all given enough screen time to flesh them out, creating a truly three-dimensional set of characters.The writing is top tier, with tense story-lines and shocking, earth-shattering twists that change the entire complexion of the episodes before. At the end of episodes, I usually found myself with my jaw agape well into the credits. And it isn't afraid to put the tension on the back-burner to deliver some slower-paced, more human moments. This creates a nice, well-balanced mix with edge of the seat stuff one episode, then poignant, well-written character-defining moments the next. A great example that comes to mind is the heart-wrenching season 3, episode 8- 'Don't delete me', that succeeds the fast paced and exhilarating episodes 5,6 and 7.I'm on my second viewing of this show. Not only does it provide and entirely different yet equally entertaining viewing experience, it highlights how great the writing is. Little lines and clues snuck in right from the very start- the finale twist was in our face the entire time but it was so well hidden no one could see it. They had the whole story planned from the very beginning and it shows- this really is top tier storytelling.Every now and then, an episode will come along with a completely different format to other episodes in the season. It keeps the viewer on their toes, guessing when another 'bottle' style episode will come up- something that really enhances the viewing experience. And these are not present just for the sake of being different- they are all really well executed. From the bizarre yet genius sitcom style opening in the second season to the juggernaut of tension story-telling silent fourth season episode. And that's not even mentioning quite possibly the best episode of the entire show- An exhilarating yet devastating stage play in the middle of season 4.All of this is underscored by the incredible original score and inspired music choices. It's no surprise I like the music given my favourite artist of all time, M83 features heavily. M83's epic 'Intro' and 'Outro' perfectly fits the world-changing, high stakes drama and makes for deservingly monumental conclusions to the final two seasons respectively. I'm not even going to get started on the immense finale, otherwise I shall be typing this review long into the night.I have to save the best till last. There is not a hint of exaggeration when I say that this is the most beautiful motion picture I have ever seen. The thought behind every camera move, the colour palette and the attention to detail that goes into every shot, every frame is breath-taking. Negative spacing to enhance characters feelings of isolation and disconnect from one another- the framing means something. And I can say that about very few pieces of media. Even little things such as stylised title cards that change from episode to episode, the letter-boxing of the screen when the filming style changes to more conventional techniques of film-making in more dramatised, movie like episodes- it all adds up to a visually striking experience.There are not enough superlatives to use when describing this show. Its rock solid writing and gorgeous cinematography shows that TV is just as much cinema as the latest multi-million pound blockbuster release. A true masterpiece that I was always be indebted to the genius Sam Esmail and the entire cast and crew for. Goodbye, friend.",

This also isn't Twin Peaks where the bizarre moments will never be explained but encouraged.The violence gets real intensive from season 3 onwards, it gives me the same intense feeling I got when watching Breaking Bad. Most importantly is how the series ends. The last seven episodes gives you a grand finale of absolute mind boggling intensity that has you shaking at the edge of your seat. Everything unfolds. The best is once you think its the end, and they cannot possibly have 2 or 3 episodes left, it blows your mind, makes you cry and really understand the world of Elliott.How a series ends has always been important to me, thats why I loved Six feet Under and Battlestar Galactica. But Mr Robot is one of the best examples of how you end a series!! The writers of the last season of Game of Thrones should have taken notes. Truly a masterpiece! It stands unique on its own.",

    "content": "In my spoiler-free summary of this show, I'm here to express what this show has done to change everything about how I think of serial drama television. I will probably come back to do a follow-up review once the show is finally over because I'm sure this won't do Mr. Robot justice while the main story is still yet to be fully unveiled.From the performances, the ever-so-slowly unraveling global conspiracy in the story/plot, the characters, the directing, the writing, the cinematography, the set design, costume design, editing, and lighting (and something else I'm sure I must be forgetting), everything is top-notch for me.What seems to turn people off of this show is how it radically changes in its second season, and even partially through its first season. I guess I can understand this, Mr. Robot isn't a show for everyone. But I appreciate this because I personally felt that Mr. Robot came into its own when it started to get super abstract and philosophical and character-focused later in season 2. That's where I feel like it really became \"Mr. Robot\" to me. No matter what, the plot moves nowhere before the characters are thoroughly explored. Those are the priorities of the show. The complex conspiracy in the main plot is often cast aside for character study and emotional development because the characters are the most important part of the story. This makes it so that once the full truth behind the conspiracy is ready to be revealed, it'll feel so much more rewarding getting to experience it with all of the characters that have had plenty of time to be thoroughly emotionally explored. Because, in the end, why care about the people in the world of the show if that aspect is being cut short for less impactful story arcs and reveals?Overall, I'm so happy I discovered this show and there is absolutely nothing like it. It is the most one-of-a-kind serial drama series ever made, truly, and undoubtedly the best television drama of the 2010s in my eyes. And that makes Mr. Robot pretty special to me.:)",

    "content": "A series with a complex screenplay, multi-layered plots and ultra-brilliant acting by the whole cast, spearheaded by the ruby-like Rami Malek who personified the character's split-paranoiac personality like a glove. A special kudos to the creator and executive producer, Sam Esmail, for his deeply thought-out screenplay, meticulous execution and impressive choice of actors.Despite the shows brilliancy and sleek seasons; some filler-like, surrealistic and \"philosophical\" events weren't to my taste and I always liked it more when the flow was brutally simple, direct, featuring awesome hacking-scripts-writing & execution and Elliot talking to himself. Also, since the beginning, it became clear to me that Christian Slater could have played with more intensity, craziness and gutsy performance. He was too slow and dull compared to Rami Malek and that ruined a little and negatively impacted on their onscreen interactions IMO.You want to feel real presence tainted with hypnotic intensity, watch Stephanie Corneliussen's performance in the show and you will understand thoroughly what I mean.A rare, sort of underrated gem in the world of series and IMO, second to 'Dark' in terms of complexity.Screenplay/story: 9.9Development: 9.9Realism: 9.5Entertainment: 9.5Acting: 9.9Filming/cinematography: 9.5Special effects: 9Music/score: 9.5Depth: 9.8Logic: 9Flow: 9.5Suspense/thrill: 9.4Ending/closure: 9",

When i started to watch this series i didn't expect much, but it has blow me away even in the first episode. A dark story about what is right and what is wrong, and the madness that that question brings. The acting is solid and so is the directing.This character, Elliot, is really drawing me in. He's so fantastically flawed, beautifully destructive, sane and insane. His outlook on the world is perhaps pessimistic, or arrogant, but there is a truth in his words - his inner dialogue that comes across as well-written poetry. By the time you're on episode four, the confusion somewhat kicks in. This is okay though, as each character is slowly becoming themselves in the show and synchronizing.I can tell how each character is going to intertwine for the most part - but Elliot is the main attraction. I believe there are people out there who are like him; snorting Morphine 30's and taking Suboxone so he doesn't withdraw - a computer genius and natural poet, and a complete sociopath who abuses his power over computers and the internet to understand the human condition and even himself.This show is well worth your time; I think even the older crowds (I'm 22) - so basically people who would be my parents, can learn something from this show. They can catch a glimpse of what we're all really like: Sociopathic internet nerds who tweet and text and share, passing information around this sterile country as if it's the very air we breath. This show captures the current zeitgeist, or overall spirit of the times - Elliot is just the extremity, of course. A job well done. I give this show a 9/10",

In short, the show is a bit unconventional, like a mix between an audio book and a TV show, but one rather well researched and executed.The acting is fairly good, the narrative style felt novel and fresh, and there's ample room for various subplots and story lines. The setting also felt real, as others have pointed out. Some interesting creative decisions were made, such as blatantly spelling out the antagonist, a company, by giving it an unmistakable name. It also makes subtle jokes and pokes fun of things probably only people in the IT industry would recognize.Whereas most shows and movies seem to throw all connection to reality straight out the window when it comes to IT related stuff, this show does not. In fact, it seems extraordinarily well researched for an entertainment piece. Being in that industry myself and having had a bit of \"fun\" as a youth, I'd have to say that overall the portrayal of IT security and hacking in this show is leaps and bounds more accurate than anything that has come before it, even if the attentive viewer would be able to spot some minute factual errors.Perchance even entertainment execs have realized they can no longer get away with silly and unbelievable things like \"magic picture enhance\", nerdy super hackers who as through divine insight guess their targets passwords in 1-2 attempts, or with peddling notions of tools that have weeks of artist design effort spent on them, for buttons that once clicked, reveal some information that would logically be impossible to get hold of through the channel used.It seems as though we finally have a show that doesn't treat its audience as idiots, and where the writers actually spent some time doing their homework. I'm just concerned that the show may be targeting too small an audience, an audience consisting of people who do not switch their brains off when they turn on the tele, and as such it may not be awarded a series contract.So far, highly recommended to tune into if you're interested in seeing something fresh and aren't allergic to narration (getting inside the mind of a somewhat odd protagonist), as there's quite lot of the latter.",

    "content": "Did USA really just do this? They have managed to give me a combination of the best parts of Swordfish AND Fight Club and managed to make it coherent, suspenseful and a joy to watch. And Christian Slater gives yet another go at TV-Land and may have finally hit the mark!The premise: A young man working at a security firm by day, and an elite hacker vigilante by night.Sounds like it would be a bore-fest full of misplaced techno jargon, dry suspense (remember BlackHat?) and poor acting, right? Wrong! Not only was I amazed at how the story was presented, but I fell in love with the main cast with some spot on character development, GOOD use of technological aspects of hacking and a great use of voice over.Color me impressed! I am a computer geek by trade and they hit the nail on the head with almost every aspect of security and defense without making grievous errors (think The Net & the worst aspects of Swordfish). This is a must see for geeks of all ages and even hits the mark for those not so tech savvy.While the show is littered with clichés, they are all so well done and accurate that I could not find this an actual fault with the show. Try as I might, I could not find any glaring faults with the dialog, character development or even the subtle \"Big Brother\" aspects that they were going for. This is a MUST continue for USA and I will be ecstatic if it gets picked up and more episodes are made (at the time of this review it appears only 1 episode has been made). Kudos for USA for taking a risk!To sum it up; if you are a tech savvy user of the internet, smart phones or computers this is an absolute MUST see. Even for those of you not so tech savvy please give this a go!",

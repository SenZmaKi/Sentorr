The plot is top-notch and it is very suspenseful, it features some of the best tv characters ever, every actors nails their role. This show also features heavy amount of Hacking, I thought that was very neat and cool, but do not expect to see too much of that aspect, the focal point of this show is really the story. Definitely a 10 out of 10 for this one.",

    "content": "Mr. Robot a true series for the age of information. I think it helps to be 30 or younger to get all the subtle nuances going on here. This old man will try to do the best he can.Our protagonist is Rami Malek a perfect product of the age of information. He's a computer programmer working for a company that's supposed to protect from cyber attack their clients, the biggest of which is a company led by Bruce Altman. Said company is under attack at the moment and the leader of the attackers is cyber anarchist Christian Slater in the title role of Mr. Robot.Malek is a flawed hero like Adrian Monk and he functions best working and living alone. He's got social anxiety and the creators of Mr. Robot have used a technique first developed by Eugene O'Neill for Strange Interlude. Through Malek's own voice over narration we get the real action because the real action is going on in his own mind.Malek is socially dysfunctional, but his skills like Monk are not to be denied. It's why Slater is recruiting him for his cadre of hackers looking to free the world of debt. Free it of debt and humankind is truly free.What I find curious is that if this show had debuted 20 years ago Slater would probably the one recruited instead of doing the recruiting. Malek's Elliott Alderson is just the kind of role that Slater would have done in his salad days.Mr. Robot is well written and acted and deals with some interesting concepts about our age of information.",

I remember i almost cried in quiet few scenes in season 3!I think this show should receive more attention and credit than it has and i truly hope they do not ruin it in season 4.",

Everything's just perfect. Any complaints you have about the show during its run, are overshadowed by the sheer genius of the 4th season.Episode 4x07 and the finale are seriously the greatest television episodes of all time.",

I was blown away because at the time he was a nobody...but he was fantastic in it and in everything He's done since. Either he's gotten very lucky with great roles and shows or he's made them great by himself... I think the later is more accurate.A must watch!!! Can't believe I overlooked it for as long as I did.",

Even the time that seems dragging out was the open the possibility for a recuperation from the twists and building up to the next twist in the same episode. I've been mindblown through the entire series and i fell in love with the cast. I must thank everyone involved in this masterpiece. It is indeed, a true mastermind! I wish the mastermind stayed after all this, he really grown on me and i was sad to see him go.

Every season has its own plot twists and always takes the story on a completely unexpected path. Rami Malek's acting and character are both outstanding.

    "content": "From the performances, the ever-so-slowly unravelling global conspiracy in the story/plot, the characters, the directing, the writing, the cinematography, the set design, costume design, editing, and lighting (and something else I'm sure I must be forgetting), everything is top-notch for me.What seems to turn people off of this show is how it radically changes in its second season, and even partially through its first season. I guess I can understand this, Mr. Robot isn't a show for everyone. But I appreciate this because I personally felt that Mr. Robot came into its own when it started to get super abstract and philosophical and character-focused later in season 2. That's where I feel like it really became \"Mr Robot\" to me. No matter what, the plot moves nowhere before the characters are thoroughly explored. Those are the priorities of the show. The complex conspiracy in the main plot is often cast aside for character study and emotional development because the characters are the most important part of the story. This makes it so that once the full truth behind the conspiracy is ready to be revealed, it'll feel so much more rewarding getting to experience it with all of the characters that have had plenty of time to be thoroughly emotionally explored. Because, in the end, why care about the people in the world of the show if that aspect is being cut short for less impactful story arcs and reveals? Truly one of the best shows on Television.Season 1 - 9.0Season 2 - 9.4Season 3 - 9.5Season 4 - 9.8.",

    "title": "Quite Possibly the Best Pilot I Have Ever Seen",
    "author": "MichaelALewis",
    "rating": 10,
    "content": "The pilot episode of this series shows great promise. At the risk of failing to appeal to the modern television viewer who has become accustomed to shows lacking true substance, it will most certainly captivate a core audience of viewers who feel alienated by the typical programming of the modern day. The narrative touches on topics like social and digital revolution through the thoughts of the protagonist as he narrates the episode. The status quo of modern social behavior, consumerism, and corporate greed prevailing by virtue of the complacency amongst the proletariat is a core issue that both the show and protagonist address with great disdain. It ironically begs the question that if our complacency with the quality of consumer items––such as substandard television programming––is so entrenched in our society, when we are finally greeted with an oasis of the kind of talented artistic expression that this show offers devoid of being dumbed-down or hollowed out in effort to appeal to a wider audience, will we be able to transcend our usual tastes, or will the level of real, thought-provoking narratives lead a disinterest among the typical armchair audience and eventually the show's demise? Much like other successful programs such as \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"House\", that received a large following despite some very technical aspects of the dialogue that tend go over-the-head of the majority of their viewers, Mr. Robot followed suit and still holds true to it's core audience by fact-checking its more technical content and preserving its validity. Most films or programs with a hacker or computer science theme tend to overplay the \"coolness\" of what is shown when it comes something as dry as computer code by representing the digital world as it it were a fantasy, in lieu of the more accurate yet bland, plain-text unix coding on a computer screen. I was surprised and also relieved to see the actual computer science portions of the episode be accurate representations of a real-life scenario down the very character. As with other successful programs with story lines derived from complex subject matter (like medicine or theoretical physics), the amount of technical dialogue is not so much that it will bore the majority of the audience who will not understand it, but just enough that it will captivate and perhaps even educate them slightly as they are offered a glimpse into a fascinating world whose power and influence they wouldn't otherwise comprehend. My hope is that USA––the network on which the show will air––will recognize that they have struck gold, and not run scared if viewership starts off slow. Most shows of this caliber do not take off will a large audience, but rather begin to amass a strong cult following and later become a huge hit. We saw this kind of skepticism among network executives with Breaking Bad. Much like the idea of a school teacher cooking meth to pay his medical bills, a computer nerd with a social disorder and possible schizophrenia working for a network security firm by day and playing social hacktivist by night is not something that immediately screams \"blockbuster\". It's my hope that the timing of this show will prove to be its greatest strength in light of recent events in the hacking and cybersecurity world involving Anonymous, Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, Ross Ulbricht, and Aaron Swartz. Viewers are educated now more than ever when it comes to hacking and the impact that individuals can make on society through their \"hacktivist\" work.The protagonist of Mr. Robot is similar in many ways to these individuals, and the plausibility of his disposition is validated by their individual plights. Where they have fallen short of their ultimate goals and failed to elude capture, the audience will root for their new favorite anti-hero since Walter White to incite a social revolution through his hacktivist work. Whether he succeeds or is met with the same demise is up to the writers who have crafted this brilliant first episode.",
